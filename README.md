# AOS (Animate on scroll library) examples

AOS is a library providing support for implementing animations
of emerging items when scrolling a page.

This repository contains some rudimentary examples on how to use AOS
based on the demos provided on
[the official repo](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos/tree/next).

## Using CDN
One option is to use AOS via CDN which makes any installation
via a package manager such as npm superfluous.

Check out the file _index-using-cdn.html_ to understand how this works.

## Install AOS as dependency
You can also use a package manager to install aos as dependency in our
project. In case of npm, you could run the following command:
```bash
npm i --save aos@next
```
Depending on the package manager and your project structure,
you might need to adapt the some paths.

Check out the file _index-using-installed-lib.html_ to see this in action.
